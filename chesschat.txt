In a swiss tournament, after the first round, preferences for the next round are the consequence of the pairings (as realized) in the previous round.

But Rule F.2 states:

[QUOTE=Rules]
F.2  Byes, and pairing not actually played, or lost by one of the
players due to arriving late or not at all, will not be taken into
account with respect to colour, Such a pairing is not considered to be
illegal in future rounds.
[/QUOTE]

So in such cases, preferences for the next round are NOT the consequence of the pairing in the previous round.

What is not clear to me is the meaning of the second sentence. Is it saying that pairings not actually played, and which might be thought to be illegal because of B1a (about players meeting more than once), are not in fact illegal.

The first part of F.2 is all about color preferences, so I think it's not clear whether the second part is also about just color preferences or all illegalities under the Rules.

So, the question is:

Is it OK for two players to meet more than once, if they didn't actually meet the first time?
