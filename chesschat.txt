At http://chesschat.org/showthread.php?t=10334, there was a discussion of how late entries would require a reassignment of pairing numbers.

Meanwhile, at http://chesschat.org/showthread.php?t=10112, there was discussion of puzzling behavior by Swiss Master with a player's "Prefixed Theoretical Color" (or default) preference.

(b) another tournament where in the third round there was a group with 8 players expecting W, 7 expecting B and one, whose PTC was 'W', playing his first game.
This is the list of the sixteen players, with their preference, divided in S1/S2:

S1 = 076w 077b 087w 101w 103w 104b 105A 107b
S2 = 110b 116b 123w 125w 126b 130b 131w 132w

To my astonishment, SM considered 105 as expecting White and therefore put x=1. The pairing generated by SM was 76-110 123-77 87-116 101-125(!) 103-126 131-104 105-130 132-107.

I would have generated: 76-110 123-77 87-116 101-126 103-130 125-104 131-105 132-107. Anything wrong with that?

I don't know whether the second is correct or not.

However, even if one late player does get a determined PTC preference, I think it is clear that late entries would not require a redetermination by lot of all other players' preferences too.

This would be distinct from the the pattern established by reassignment of pairing numbers, where everyone gets a new number.

On the other hand, what about the case of a new player turning up before the first round has been played, and in the very short instance of time BEFORE pairings have been decided, but AFTER pairing numbers have been assigned and preferences have been determined by lot?

Here, I think it is clear that preferences WOULD be redetermined for all players.

I am assuming in the first round, preferences are determined before pairings are made, because this is how it happens in later rounds. The preferences for the next round are the consequence of the pairings (as realized) in the previous round.

I'm making a point of this because Games::Tournament::Swiss, as I have written it, is pairing a latecomer in the first round as
