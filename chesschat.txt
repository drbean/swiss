I'm glad I asked. This is not the answer I was expecting.

[QUOTE=gletsos]
   Late entrants need to be seeded into the player list based on their
   rating.

Presumably the score they have at the moment is NOT considered in determining the pairing number, even though the way the Rules talk about determining order might suggest otherwise.

[QUOTE=FIDE]
A.2 Order
For pairing purposes only, the players are ranked in order of,
respectively
 a. score
 b. rating
 c. FIDE-title (IGM-WGM-IM-WIM-FM-WFM-no title)
 d. alphabetically (unless it has been previously stated that this
    criterion has been replaced by another one)

The order made before the first round (when all scores are obviously
zero) is used to determine the pairing numbers: the highest one gets
#1 etc.
[/QUOTE]

But, a. score should NOT be used in the renumbering. Is that correct?

[QHOTE=gletsos]
   If this means renumbering the player pairing numbers when players are
   added then so be it.
[/QUOTE]

Are the players able to make sense of the pairing table with the changes in their pairing numbers and those of the people they played?

Incidentally, the rules talk about making an estimation of players' ratings, if
they are unknown, before the start of the tournament. How do arbiters do this?
If they do not know the players at all, do they ask them about their chess experience? Or do they just give them a 0 rating?
